# HMMComparison

To re-run the experiments from the JOSS paper, clone the repository, start a Julia REPL and run

```julia
include("libs/HMMComparison/experiments/measurements.jl")
include("libs/HMMComparison/experiments/plots.jl")
```

The results and plots will appear in `libs/HMMComparison/experiments/results/`.
