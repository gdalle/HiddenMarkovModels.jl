# Alternatives

## List

For exact inference in HMMs, we have identified the following Julia packages:

* [HMMBase.jl]
* [HMMGradients.jl]
* [MarkovModels.jl]

and the following Python packages:

* [hmmlearn]
* [pomegranate]

There are also more generic packages for probabilistic programming, which are able to perform MCMC or variational inference (eg. [Turing.jl]) but we leave those aside.

## Features

We only compare features among Julia packages (except [MarkovModels.jl], whose creators we have contacted to obtain support).
If you are interested in performance, the benchmarks page also includes both Python packages.
