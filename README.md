A Julia package for simulation, inference and learning of [Hidden Markov Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model).

## Getting started

This package can be installed using Julia's package manager:

```julia
pkg> add HiddenMarkovModels
```

Then, you can create your first model as follows:

```julia
using Distributions, HiddenMarkovModels
init = [0.4, 0.6]
trans = [0.9 0.1; 0.2 0.8]
dists = [Normal(-1.0), Normal(1.0)]
hmm = HMM(init, trans, dists)
```

Take a look at the [documentation](https://gdalle.github.io/HiddenMarkovModels.jl/stable/) to know what to do next!

## Some background

HMMs are a widely used modeling framework in signal processing, bioinformatics and plenty of other fields.
They capture the distribution of an observation sequence $(Y_t)$ by assuming the existence of a latent state sequence $(X_t)$ such that:

* the state follows a (discrete time, discrete space) Markov chain $\mathbb{P}_\theta(X_t | X_{t-1})$
* the observation distribution is determined at each time by the state $\mathbb{P}_\theta(Y_t | X_t)$

Each of the problems below has an efficient solution algorithm which our package implements:

| Problem    | Goal                                                                                                      | Algorithm        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Evaluation | Likelihood of the observation sequence $\mathbb{P}_\theta(Y_{1:T})$                                       | Forward          |
| Filtering | Non-anticipative state marginals $\mathbb{P}_\theta(X_t \vert Y_{1:t})$                                       | Forward          |
| Smoothing  | State marginals $\mathbb{P}_\theta(X_t \vert Y_{1:T})$                                                    | Forward-backward |
| Decoding   | Most likely state sequence $\underset{X_{1:T}}{\mathrm{argmax}}~\mathbb{P}_\theta(X_{1:T} \vert Y_{1:T})$ | Viterbi          |
| Learning   | Maximum likelihood parameter $\underset{\theta}{\mathrm{argmax}}~\mathbb{P}_\theta(Y_{1:T})$                            | Baum-Welch       |

## Main features

This package is **generic**.
Observations can be arbitrary Julia objects, not just scalars or arrays.
Number types are not restricted to floating point, which enables automatic differentiation.
Time-heterogeneous or controlled HMMs are supported out of the box.

This package is **fast**.
All the inference functions have allocation-free versions, which leverage efficient linear algebra subroutines.
We will include extensive benchmarks against Julia and Python competitors.

This package is **reliable**.
It gives the same results as the previous reference package up to numerical accuracy.
The test suite incorporates quality checks as well as type stability and allocation analysis.
