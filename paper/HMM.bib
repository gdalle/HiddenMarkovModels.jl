We combine theoretical insights with efficient algorithms, and develop several open source Julia libraries. Inspired by a collaboration with the Soci{\'e}t{\'e} nationale des chemins de fer fran{\c c}ais (SNCF), we study high-impact use cases from the railway world: train failure prediction, delay propagation, and track allocation. In Part I, we provide mathematical background and describe software implementations for various tools that will be needed later on: implicit differentiation, temporal point processes, Hidden Markov Models and Multi-Agent Path Finding. Our publicly available code fills a void in the Julia package ecosystem, aiming at ease of use without compromising on performance. In Part II, we highlight theoretical contributions related to both statistics and decision-making. We consider a Vector AutoRegressive process with partial observations, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation error. We unify and extend the state of the art for combinatorial optimization layers in deep learning, gathering various approaches in a Julia library called InferOpt.jl. We also seek to differentiate through multi-objective optimization layers, which leads to a novel theory of lexicographic convex analysis. In Part III, these mathematical and algorithmic foundations come together to tackle railway problems. We design a hierarchical model of train failures, propose a graph-based framework for delay propagation, and suggest new avenues for track allocation, with the Flatland challenge as a testing ground.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) provides an effective approach for modeling single channel kinetics. Standard HMM is based on Baum's reestimation. As applied to single channel currents, the algorithm has the inability to optimize the rate constants directly. We present here an alternative approach by considering the problem as a general optimization problem. The quasi-Newton method is used for searching the likelihood surface. The analytical derivatives of the likelihood function are derived, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the optimization. Because the rate constants are optimized directly, the approach has advantages such as the allowance for model constraints and the ability to simultaneously fit multiple data sets obtained at different experimental conditions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. Comparisons with Baum's reestimation suggest that the approach has a superior convergence speed when the likelihood surface is poorly defined due to, for example, a low signal-to-noise ratio or the aggregation of multiple states having identical conductances.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{$<>$}},

In particular, it covers a range of efficient non-linear Gaussian filtering and smoothing algorithms, as well as Monte Carlo-based algorithms. This updated edition features new chapters on constructing state space models of practical systems, the discretization of continuous-time state space models, Gaussian filtering by enabling approximations, posterior linearization filtering, and the corresponding smoothers. Coverage of key topics is expanded, including extended Kalman filtering and smoothing, and parameter estimation. The book's practical, algorithmic approach assumes only modest mathematical prerequisites, suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate students. Many examples are included, with Matlab and Python code available online, enabling readers to implement algorithms in their own projects.},
